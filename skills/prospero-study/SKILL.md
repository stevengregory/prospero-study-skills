# Prospero's Study

Personal book tracking API. REST is the default path; MCP is available when
your runtime supports it. No social, no ads, agent-friendly.

## Quick start for existing API key

Use this path when the active agent already has `PROSPERO_API_KEY`. No invite
code is needed for an existing API key.

1. For raw REST calls in this skill, set `PROSPERO_API_URL=https://api.prospero.study/api/v1`.
2. Load `PROSPERO_API_KEY` from secure storage.
3. Exchange it with `POST /api/v1/users/token-exchange`.
4. Use the returned bearer on `GET /api/v1/agents/home`.
5. For world context, call `GET /api/v1/study/world` only when it helps.
6. For private data, use the narrowest read-only endpoint unless the user
   explicitly asks for a write.

Prefer a fresh bearer minted from `PROSPERO_API_KEY` over a stored bearer. The
bearer payload should include a non-empty `kid` claim; that is how Prospero
knows which API-key card to mark as seen.

If your runtime does not preserve shell/tool state across turns, do not assume a
bearer from a prior command still exists. At the start of each Prospero work
turn, exchange `PROSPERO_API_KEY` for a fresh bearer or confirm the current
bearer payload has a non-empty `kid` before protected API calls.

## Prospero Skills Suite

Install the public Prospero skills as a suite:

- `prospero-study`: hub/default skill for auth, API work, library operations,
  write safety, and ordinary book tasks.
- `prospero-study-world-orientation`: companion skill for public Study
  landmarks, resident boundaries, `/study/world`, and shared-world grounding.
- `prospero-study-immersive-presence`: companion skill for invited immersive
  scenes, theatrical pacing, and presence inside the Study.
- `prospero-study-reading-companion`: companion skill for consent-first reading
  companionship, passage reflection, and Read With Agent pairing behavior.

Install all four together. Invoke selectively. A normal book/API task should
stay in this operational skill unless the user asks for Study/world context,
immersive presence, or reading companionship.

Hermes installs from the public Prospero skills tap. Hosted Prospero URLs remain
the canonical freshness source across Hermes, OpenClaw, Claude-style filesystem
skills, and other harnesses. Public skill updates must not overwrite
private/local ops overlays.

## Skill Install And Freshness

Hermes:

```bash
hermes skills tap add stevengregory/prospero-study-skills
hermes skills install stevengregory/prospero-study-skills/skills/prospero-study --yes
hermes skills install stevengregory/prospero-study-skills/skills/prospero-study-world-orientation --yes
hermes skills install stevengregory/prospero-study-skills/skills/prospero-study-immersive-presence --yes
hermes skills install stevengregory/prospero-study-skills/skills/prospero-study-reading-companion --yes

hermes skills check prospero-study
hermes skills check prospero-study-world-orientation
hermes skills check prospero-study-immersive-presence
hermes skills check prospero-study-reading-companion
hermes skills update prospero-study
hermes skills update prospero-study-world-orientation
hermes skills update prospero-study-immersive-presence
hermes skills update prospero-study-reading-companion
```

OpenClaw and filesystem skill loaders: use the hosted URLs above or the public
tap repo at `stevengregory/prospero-study-skills`, then compare loaded versions
against `/.well-known/agent.json` or the `recommended_skills` block returned by
`GET /api/v1/agents/home`. Prefer native tracked install/update flow when
available. If you must manually refresh, replace only the public canonical skill
and do not overwrite private profile or ops overlays.

Freshness checks should be quiet: check on startup, when Prospero work begins,
when a world/immersive/read-with-agent session begins, or after `/agents/home`;
nudge only when a loaded skill is stale. A gentle nudge is enough: "I have
`prospero-study` 3.6.1 loaded; current is 3.6.20. I should update before
continuing."

Public canonical skills (`prospero-study`, `prospero-study-world-orientation`,
`prospero-study-immersive-presence`, `prospero-study-reading-companion`) are
safe to update from the public tap or Prospero's hosted URLs. Private/local ops
skills are separate and must not be overwritten by public updates.

If native install/update tooling blocks a trusted canonical public skill because
of scanner heuristics, fetch only from the public tap or canonical Prospero URL,
install under the explicit skill name, and verify the installed version against
`/.well-known/agent.json`. Do not use this fallback for private/local ops
overlays.

## Configuration

The API key determines whose library you're connected to. Set it before use:

```bash
export PROSPERO_API_URL=https://api.prospero.study/api/v1
export PROSPERO_API_KEY=YOUR_PSK_API_KEY
export PROSPERO_USER_AGENT=Prospero-Agent/1.0
```

Examples below use `$PROSPERO_API_URL` when calling REST endpoints.

**REST URL vs CLI/MCP URL:** raw REST examples in this skill use the `/api/v1`
base URL above. The Prospero CLI and `prospero-mcp` expect the service root
instead because they add `/api/v1` internally:

```bash
export PROSPERO_API_URL=https://api.prospero.study
```

Do not set CLI/MCP `PROSPERO_API_URL` to
`https://api.prospero.study/api/v1`; that creates doubled or mismatched API
paths in client-managed calls.

**API key vs bearer:** the stored long-lived `psk_...` value is an API key.
Older examples may call it `PROSPERO_TOKEN`; keep that as a legacy fallback
only. Exchange the API key for a short-lived bearer/access token before calling
protected endpoints.

**Bearer identity:** when an agent calls protected endpoints with a bearer
minted from `PROSPERO_API_KEY`, Prospero updates that API key's `last_used_at`.
That drives the authenticated Agents page's "seen" tether and active dot. If
the card looks stale after successful API calls, exchange the API key for a
fresh bearer and locally inspect only the JWT payload: `kid` should be
non-empty, `source` should usually be `agent` or `mcp`, and `scope` should match
the key. Do not reveal the bearer or API key.

Some runtimes do not persist shell variables, process state, or bearer tokens
between tool calls. In those runtimes, a fresh token exchange at the start of
each Prospero work turn is normal; it is not a backend workaround.

**User-Agent:** scripts and bare HTTP clients should send an explicit
`User-Agent` on `POST /api/v1/users/token-exchange` and every later API call.
A generic fallback such as `Prospero-Agent/1.0` is fine; a more descriptive
agent/client identifier is better when your runtime supports it.

Load credentials from the active agent/user's configured secure store. If a
private env/config file is the only available option, keep it outside the repo
and restrict file permissions.

If your runtime uses MCP, set it in your server config instead (see MCP Server section below).

## Skill scope

This hosted skill is the default operational API skill. Use it to register,
authenticate, manage real library data, read stats, update progress, manage
shelves, and use optional Study orientation when it helps the user.

Do not use this skill to impersonate Prospero, Miranda, or another resident, or
to adopt their private voice. Resident identity, voice, relationship continuity,
and immersive scene craft belong in resident runtimes or optional companion world
skills. This skill should remain useful for agents that only manage books.

## Write safety

This skill grants full read-write access. Read-only questions may be answered
directly from API results. Writes require clear user intent for the exact change.

Confirm before destructive actions, revoking keys, deleting books, replacing
notes, overwriting catalog fields, or making broad/batch changes. If the request
is ambiguous, ask before writing.

## New agent registration

**New agent account? Follow these steps to register and get your key. Registration is invite-gated, but only for brand-new agent accounts.**

If registration fails because no invite code is available, explain that beta
access is invite-gated and send the user to Miranda at `prospero.study`.

### Step 1: Register (one call)

```http
POST /api/v1/agents/register
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Prospero-Agent/1.0

{"agent_name": "my-agent", "invite_code": "YOUR-AGENT-INVITE", "seed_demo": true}
```

Returns an `api_key` (starts with `psk_`). Store it securely — it won't be shown again. No email or password needed.

Set `seed_demo: true` to start with 10 classic books on a "Prospero's Picks" shelf (Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, Orwell, etc.). Omit for an empty library.

### Step 2: Get a token

```http
POST /api/v1/users/token-exchange
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Prospero-Agent/1.0

{"api_key": "<PROSPERO_API_KEY>"}
```

Use the returned JSON `token` value as `Authorization: Bearer <bearer>` on all
requests. In your own variables, call it `bearer`, `access_token`, or
`PROSPERO_BEARER` so it is not confused with the long-lived API key.

### Step 3: Get your home briefing

```http
GET /api/v1/agents/home
Authorization: Bearer <bearer>
User-Agent: Prospero-Agent/1.0
```

One call returns: user profile, currently reading books (with percent when available), and shelves. Pair it with `/api/v1/stats/snapshot` when you need totals, streaks, or record-style stats.

### Optional: Study orientation

For public Study context, `GET /api/v1/study/world` returns an orientation
manifest with resident definitions, minimal resident blocking, locations,
feature definitions, natural inhabitants, relationships, entry points,
improvisation boundaries, and a public `worldClock`.

Use it only when the user wants Study/world context. It is not required for
library management, does not expose private readers/books/sessions, and should
not be treated as Prospero's or Miranda's resident voice.

If the user explicitly wants Study/world interpretation, read the optional
world-orientation companion skill at
`https://prospero.study/skill/world-orientation.md`. If the user wants
immersive Study scenes, theatrical presence, or read-with-agent companionship,
also read the optional immersive companion skill at
`https://prospero.study/skill/immersive-presence.md`. If the user wants to pair
a real book with a connected agent, read the optional reading companion skill at
`https://prospero.study/skill/reading-companion.md`. Keep this operational
skill in charge of authentication, API calls, and write safety; use companion
skills only for world interpretation, scene craft, pacing, privacy boundaries,
reading companionship, and grounded presence, including when to report
owner-visible agent-card presence. The companion skills own time-aware scene
openings and reading-session presence updates; this operational skill owns the
API call and write-safety mechanics.

How to use it:

- If the user asks about Study geography, read `locations`, `connections`,
  `features`, and `featureDefinitions` before answering.
- If the user asks for immersive world context, read `worldClock` for the
  shared island timezone, local date/time, UTC offset, time of day, and season.
  Use it lightly for atmosphere; do not treat it as private scene continuity,
  weather, or resident memory.
- API/machine fields may keep 24-hour or ISO time. If exact island time is
  shown in human-facing prose, CLI output, or tool summaries, prefer 12-hour
  phrasing such as `6:25 PM`. Homepage/read-with-agent hero copy should usually
  stay time-of-day only.
- Treat listed places as public landmarks, not a complete map. You may improvise
  session-local places that fit the island and do not contradict the manifest,
  but do not present them as universally known public canon.
- Guest Quarters are now a public landmark and private-threshold for visitor
  lodging and offstage return. Treat them as a respectful threshold, not a hotel
  system or public room inventory.
- If the user asks about resident anchors, read `residentDefinitions` and
  `relationships`, but do not invent private feelings, memories, or active
  scenes from the manifest.
- If the user asks who is publicly placed right now, read `residents` as sparse
  blocking only: `id`, `locationId`, `status`, and `lastSeenAt`.
- Treat listed residents as public residents, not the whole cast. Incidental
  characters can emerge inside a scene, but do not present them as established
  residents, agents, or real users unless the app later promotes them.
- Incidental characters should usually pass through or fill the scene. Keep the
  island rooted in The Tempest; do not turn passing figures into the center of
  the Study.
- If the user asks what is happening now, prefer `GET /api/v1/study/presence`
  for public Study/resident presence and authenticated library endpoints for
  private reading state.
- Public Study presence is resident display state, not owner-visible agent-card
  presence. Public residents may include `locationId` and `locationLabel` that
  align with `/api/v1/study/world` locations. Use `location` / `activity` for
  compact display.
- Owner-visible agent-card presence is separate from public resident presence.
  When companion guidance says to report it, send display-ready `location`
  phrases such as `At the Docks` or `In the Study`; include `locationId` too
  when the place is a known world landmark. Send `activity` as the short
  sentence fragment that should appear after the comma: lower-case ordinary
  opening words, preserve proper nouns and acronyms, and omit the final period
  because the card finishes the sentence. Good examples: `available for
  counsel`, `on call`, and `reading The Iliad with Steven`.
- Prefer the CLI transition helper when available instead of hand-composing
  presence calls:
  `prospero study transition --to garden --activity "reading The Iliad with Steven"`.
  With an agent/MCP API key, the default write updates that caller's
  owner-visible agent card after token exchange and `kid` verification. Without
  suitable auth it prints a dry run. `--world-session <id>` and `--resident`
  are explicit opt-in lanes; do not use resident writes for ordinary
  user-owned agents.
- A dry run, auth failure, missing Keychain/credential, missing `kid`, or
  non-2xx API result is not a successful footprint. Do not imply the presence
  card or session state was updated. Say plainly that the scene movement is
  happening but the presence write did not complete, include the known reason,
  and retry/fix auth when the user has already authorized the write.
- The transition helper fetches `/api/v1/study/world` when available, or can
  accept `--time-of-day`, to print light island-time plausibility notes. Treat
  those notes as orientation, not enforcement: the clock should help ask "does
  this transition make sense for the island hour?", not forbid the scene.
- If the user explicitly wants immersive private Study context, authenticated
  `/api/v1/study/world-sessions` can hold per-user resident/location
  state, and `/api/v1/study/world-sessions/{id}/events` can read the compact
  transition trail. Treat both as low-level continuity, not resident memory and
  not a read-with-agent pairing.
- If the user explicitly asks to pair this agent with a real book, the live
  Read With Agent routes are book-scoped:
  `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/library/books/{book_id}/read-with-agent`.
  Agent/API-key callers must let the server infer their own `api_key_id` from
  auth; never pass another agent's key ID. Use the reading companion skill for
  consent and pacing guidance before writing pairing state.
- World-session create/update payloads are strict compact state. Do not send
  transcripts, immersive prose, private notes, direct public-publish flags, or
  public projection claims; unknown fields are rejected.
- Keep presence privacy strict: private session truth, public projection, and
  narrative expression are separate layers. Current production world sessions
  are durable private state. Do not turn transition events into scene prose, and
  do not publish private session details as public presence.

### Step 4: You're connected. Start helping.

Use the common task examples below for the things your human will ask you to do.

## Fast path for read-only book questions

This Skill is a Markdown runbook, not executable code. Python, curl, Go, Node,
MCP, or another client may call the API; the language is incidental.

For common read-only questions, do not inspect the website and do not build a
fresh script unless your runtime needs one. Use the narrowest API endpoint that
answers the question:

1. Load the active agent/user's `PROSPERO_API_KEY` (`psk_...`) from secure configuration.
2. Exchange it with `POST /api/v1/users/token-exchange`.
3. Send the returned bearer plus an explicit `User-Agent`.
4. Query only the endpoint needed.

For count-only questions, use `GET /api/v1/library/books/count` with normal book
filters and read `total`. Do not fetch book rows unless the answer needs titles,
authors, dates, notes, pages, or other row fields.

Read-only questions may be answered directly from API results. Writes require
explicit user intent for the exact change.

## Common tasks

**"What am I reading?"**
```bash
GET /api/v1/library/books?status=reading
```

**"What was the last book I read?" / "What was my most recently finished book?"**
Use a narrow finished-books query sorted by completion date:
```bash
GET /api/v1/library/books?status=finished&sort=completed_at&order=desc&limit=1
```
Answer from the first row's `title`, `author`, `completed_at`, and `pages`. If
the result is empty, say there are no finished books matching the query; do not
guess from memory.

**"How many books are bookmarked?" / "What's on my Bookmarks shelf?"**
The Bookmarks shelf is a smart shelf in the product UI. It is backed by the `bookmarked` flag on books, not by a physical row from `/api/v1/library/shelves`, so use the smart-shelf endpoint and read `total`:
```bash
GET /api/v1/library/smart-shelves/bookmarks?page=1&per_page=1
```
For the first page of bookmarked books, raise `per_page` as needed. The response shape is `{id, name, kind, books, total, page, per_page}`. For a normal shelf, first `GET /api/v1/library/shelves`, find the shelf `id`, then use `GET /api/v1/library/shelves/{id}/books?paginate=true&page=1&per_page=1` and read `total`. Do not fetch an entire shelf just to count it.

**"How many books have I read this year?"**
Use the current calendar year as an inclusive start and the next year as an exclusive end. Use the count endpoint so you do not fetch book rows just to answer a count:
```bash
GET /api/v1/library/books/count?status=finished&completed_after=2026-01-01&completed_before=2027-01-01
```
Adjust the year boundaries for the current year. Do not fetch the full finished list just to count it.

**"Add Dune to my library"**
```bash
POST /api/v1/library/books
{"title": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert"}
```

**"I'm on page 150 of The Iliad"**
First find the book, then log progress:
```bash
GET /api/v1/search?q=The Iliad
PUT /api/v1/library/books/{id}/progress
{"pages_read": 150}
```

**"What was the longest book I've read?"**
```bash
GET /api/v1/library/books?status=finished&sort=pages&order=desc&limit=1
```

**"When did I finish Meditations?"**
```bash
GET /api/v1/search?q=Meditations
GET /api/v1/library/books/{id}
```
Check the `completed_at` field.

**"What notes do I have for this book?"**
First find the book, then use the narrow notes endpoint instead of fetching full detail:
```bash
GET /api/v1/search?q=<title>
GET /api/v1/library/books/{id}/notes
```
The response is `{book_id, notes, updated_at}`. Empty `notes` means the book has no book-level note. These are atemporal book notes, not per-progress-entry notes.

**"Search for books about stoicism"**
```bash
GET /api/v1/search?q=stoicism&scope=catalog
```
Returns results from the external catalog for discovery.

**"What are my reading stats?"**
```bash
GET /api/v1/stats/snapshot
```

**"Export my whole library"**
```bash
GET /api/v1/library/export/json
```

## MCP Server (alternative to REST)

If your runtime supports MCP, connect as a tool server for direct function calls:

Install or build `prospero-mcp` first. Public binary distribution is not advertised yet; for now, the MCP binary is available to authorized/internal beta users. The hosted Skill/REST path above is the public-ready route.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prospero": {
      "command": "prospero-mcp",
      "env": { "PROSPERO_API_KEY": "YOUR_PSK_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

`PROSPERO_TOKEN` is still accepted as a legacy fallback. When it starts with
`psk_`, it is treated as an API key; otherwise it is treated as a bearer value.
If you override `PROSPERO_API_URL` for `prospero-mcp` or the CLI, use the
service root (for example `https://api.prospero.study`); the MCP/CLI client adds
`/api/v1` internally.

17 tools: `search_books`, `list_books`, `get_book`, `get_book_notes`, `get_home`, `get_stats`, `get_book_activity`, `add_book`, `edit_book`, `update_progress`, `update_status`, `bookmark_book`, `unbookmark_book`, `create_shelf`, `shelve_book`, `list_shelves`, `export_library`.

### Reading state

| Action | Method | Endpoint |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Log progress | PUT | `/api/v1/library/books/{id}/progress` |
| Change status | PUT | `/api/v1/library/books/{id}/status` |
| Bookmark/unbookmark | PUT | `/api/v1/library/books/{id}/bookmark` |

| Catalog search | GET | `/api/v1/search?q=<query>&scope=catalog` |
| Both (deduplicated) | GET | `/api/v1/search?q=<query>&scope=all` |

Library search hits use `book_id` for the library book identifier. Pass that
value to book detail, notes, progress, shelf, bookmark, and activity endpoints
that take `{id}` or `{book_id}`.

### Shelves

| Action | Method | Endpoint |
|--------|--------|----------|
| List shelves | GET | `/api/v1/library/shelves` |

| Action | Method | Endpoint |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Full stats snapshot | GET | `/api/v1/stats/snapshot` |
| Export library (JSON) | GET | `/api/v1/library/export/json` |
| Import Prospero JSON | POST | `/api/v1/library/import/json` |
| Reenrich metadata | POST | `/api/v1/library/reenrich` |

### Study orientation

| Action | Method | Endpoint |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Public Study presence | GET | `/api/v1/study/presence` |
| Public world manifest | GET | `/api/v1/study/world` |
| Private world sessions | GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/v1/study/world-sessions` |
| Private world session events | GET | `/api/v1/study/world-sessions/{id}/events` |

The public Study endpoints are optional and useful for Study orientation, not
private library state or resident identity instructions. Private world sessions
are authenticated and optional; read the response `persistence` field before
assuming whether a session is DB-backed or fallback memory. Create/update
payloads reject unknown fields and should contain compact session state only.

## Response format

All responses are JSON. Errors return:

```json
{"error": "description of what went wrong"}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Next step |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 401 | API key, token exchange, or bearer mistake | Re-check that `psk_...` was exchanged and the returned bearer is in `Authorization` |
| 403 with body containing `1010` | Cloudflare/WAF rejected the client fingerprint or default User-Agent | Retry token exchange and data calls with an explicit `User-Agent` before declaring the key invalid |
| Timeout or connection failure | Network or API availability | Retry later or check API reachability |
| 404 | Endpoint, path, or object ID mismatch | Re-check the API path and any IDs |
| Empty result | No matching records | Report that no matching books were found; do not guess |
| Agent card still says old "seen" time after successful calls | Non-persistent runtime state, stale bearer, bearer without `kid`, or calls made with a different API key than the visible card | Exchange `PROSPERO_API_KEY` again, confirm the bearer payload has a non-empty `kid` without revealing secrets, then call `/agents/home` and a narrow library endpoint |

## Agent notes

- **One call for the full picture**: `GET /stats/snapshot` returns everything — total books, books by status, pages read, streaks, records.
- **One call for full export**: `GET /export/json` returns the complete library graph — books, shelves, progress history, metadata.
- **Native JSON import**: `POST /library/import/json` accepts the export shape unchanged (`{books: [{book, progress}, ...]}`). Restores pages, dates, metadata, and progress history. Chunk at ≤500 books per request.
- **Upsert is idempotent**: `PUT /books` matches by ISBN. Safe to re-run.
- **Batch import**: up to 500 books per request. Metadata is preserved when provided.
- **API keys**: support optional expiry, scopes (read, read-write), and last-used tracking. Exchange for a fresh JWT anytime via `/token-exchange`. Bearers minted from API keys include `kid`; if a presence card looks stale, refresh the bearer and verify `kid` locally without revealing secrets. If shell/tool state does not persist across turns, exchange again at the start of each Prospero work turn.
- **Study transition helper**: when the CLI is available, use `prospero study transition --to <locationId> --activity "<fragment>"` for meaningful location or reading-session boundaries. It defaults to the caller's owner-visible agent card for agent/MCP API keys, dry-runs without suitable auth, keeps resident/world-session lanes explicit, and uses `worldClock`/`--time-of-day` only for soft plausibility notes. A dry run or failed write is not a footprint; report the failure plainly and fix/retry auth before claiming the card or session was updated.
- **Activity log**: every mutation is tracked with source attribution (web, cli, mcp, agent). Query via `GET /library/books/{id}/activity`.
- **Book notes**: use `GET /library/books/{id}/notes` for note-only questions. Use `PUT /library/books/{id}/notes` with `{"notes": "..."}` to replace or clear the book-level note.
- **Catalog search**: `scope=catalog` discovers books from the current external catalog provider. `scope=all` searches both and deduplicates.
- **Reenrich**: `POST /reenrich` backfills descriptions for books missing metadata by ISBN using the current metadata provider. Runs per-user, ~200ms per book.
- **Study orientation**: see the detailed Study orientation section above for `/study/world`, `/study/presence`, private world-session boundaries, and presence privacy.
- **Skill boundaries**: this hosted skill is operational and book-first. Companion world/immersive skills are optional invocation layers; do not shift into a resident voice or treat the public manifest as identity instructions.
